# Mental health

Everyone has mental health; it can be in a good or not so good place at times. Struggling with your mental health is nothing to be embarassed about and needs help; just like if you have physical health issues, e.g. you would go to a doctor and not try to 'get on with things' whilst hopping around on a broken leg.

LSTM is offering several courses to highten awareness and train managers to better spot mental health issues, be able to help in the first conversation and if appropriate link people with professional help, and reduce the still widespread stigma around mental health issues. Eva is now a trained [iACT manager](https://www.i-act.co.uk/), part of [LSTM's Mental Health Champions](https://twitter.com/lstmwellbeing), and about to finish her training to become a fully accredited Mental Health First Aider by the [MHFAEngland](https://mhfaengland.org/). Cintia very kindly used one of our lab meetings to highlight mental health support available around LSTM as well as other tips to increase your wellbeing; and we will repeat a session like this as time goes by in our lab meetings to keep everyone up to date. 

As academia can be very frustrating; here are some mental health comics several of us find very helpful to keep us grounded at times; [TheAwkwardYeti](https://theawkwardyeti.com/) (also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/theawkwardyeti)), [BuddyGator](https://www.buddygator.com/) (also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/buddygatorcomic) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/buddygatorcomics/)) and of course the wonderful [Dinos](https://dinosandcomics.com/) (also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dino_comics) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dinosandcomics/)).
