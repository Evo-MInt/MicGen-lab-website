  description: MInUUR is a snakemake pipeline to extract unmapped whole genome shotgun sequencing reads and utilise a range of metagenomic analyses to characterise host-associated microbes. Orginally, MInUUR was intended to be used for the extraction of mosquito-associated bacterial symbionts, however, its application can be applied to other host-associated WGS data. MInUUR aims to leverage pre-existing WGS data to 'scavenge' for microbial information pertaining to host associated microbiomes - the key advantage being metagenomic reads as inputs to produce genus & species level classifications, functional inference and assembly of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs).

  description: This is a fantastic collection E. coli genomes by my previous PhD student, [Gal Horesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/galhoresh/?originalSubdomain=uk), whom I was co-supervising whilst I was staff in the team of [Nick Thomson](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/thomson-nicholas/) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. We hope that saves anyone interested a huge amount of time by being able to dive right into analyses rather than sorting out a genome collection!
