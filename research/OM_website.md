# Bacterial cell envelope polysaccharides and proteins #

## The cell envelope - the bacterial 'handshake' ##

When gram-negative bacteria interact with the environment, everything has to happen via the cell envelope - even secreted cytoplasmic proteins have to pass a secretion machinery that is located in the inner and outer membrane. The cell envelope thus provides us with something like an archive of records who the bacteria interact with; whether it is competing with other bacteria (leading to structures like the type VI secretion system or other bacteria-bacteria warfare machines as for example in [_Serratia_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.11.475790v1)); escaping phage pressure (and thus having high evolutionary pressure to regularly change the polysaccharide structure the phages might evolve to attach to and thus rendering it highly diverse, such as _Klebsiella_ [LPS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28348868/) and its [capsule](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29618504/); or attaching to host cells (via e.g. [adhesins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=heinz+lithgow) that specifically bind receptors on epithelial cells in the human urogenital tract).

## Why are we interested in them, and what do we do? ##

Understanding the cell envelope is interesting from an [evolutionary](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=heinz_e+henderson_i) point of view, and also has very clear practical implications; most notably in the case of opportunistic gram-negative pathogens as vaccine targets and by conferring intrinsic resistance. Our work addresses both of these in collaboration with several colleagues around the globe as we try to combine large-scale genomic data with knowledge of protein evolution, structure and function. Ongoing key research projects include large-scale analyses of _Klebsiella_ and _Escherichia coli_, both looking for key vaccine targets and to better understand the impact of the cell surface on antimicrobial resistance; some of our key collaborators here are [Nick Feasey](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-nicholas-feasey), [Tom Edwards](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-thomas-edwards), [Alex Bateman](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/alex-bateman/) and [Joe Campo](https://antigendiscovery.com/), currently funded by [the BMGF](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/).
