# _Wolbachia_ as vector control tool. #

## Who is _Wolbachia_, and why is it interesting? ##

_Wolbachia_ is a widespread insect symbiont, and can influence their host population.

## The bigger project ##

We collaborate with Grant Hughes' team internally; and with Tom (LSHTM, UK), Antonio (Cameroon) and Marcel and Charles Wondji (CRID, Cameroon); who are experts in the biology and the entomology of their hosts.

## Host-symbiont (co)evolution ##

Our contribution to this team effort is to understand the genome evolution and co-adaptation between host and symbiont. 

No _Wolbachia_ in _Anopheles gambiae_.
