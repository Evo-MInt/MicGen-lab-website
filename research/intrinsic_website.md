A key area of our research here is on beta-lactam-beta-lacatamase-inhibitor combinations, and how intrinsic resistance mechanisms against these are regulated as this is often a result of resistance gene upregulation or plasmid upregulation. We are currently [investigating TAZ resistance](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000789) in projects with [Thomas Edwards](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-thomas-edwards) and collaborators, including since recently running our own in-house short- and long-read sequencing!
