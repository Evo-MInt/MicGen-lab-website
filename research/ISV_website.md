# Insect-specific viruses: biology and vector control. #

## Who are insect-specific viruses (ISVs)? ##

Insect-specific viruses are associated with insects, but can not replicate in vertebrate cells. The recent expansion of sequencing data has opened a window into an incredible diversity of ISVs which we are only beginning to understand. Importantly, work by our collaborator Ian Patterson has shown that they can inhibit the entry of arboviruses, a phenomenon called ['superinfection exclusion'](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.00433-21), which is of high interest from a biological perspective as well as a potential novel vector control tool. The mechanism of this super-infection exclusion, and how conserved it is between different host-ISV-arbovirus combinations, is not understood and a key question we are interested in.

## Why are we interested in them, and what do we do? ##

The presence of specific viruses in mosquitoes opens a range of interesting biological as well as translational questions - are they essential for their hosts, what is the ISV diversity in the field, and how do they interact with pathogens; are they able to block the infection of a mosquito cell by other viruses, and can we use them for arbovirus control?
This work is a strong collaboration with [Ian Patterson](https://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/biology/directory/ian-patterson/), an expert virologist who has a long-standing experience working on ISVs, and his newly-built team at [Brock University](https://brocku.ca/); and [Jennifer Lord](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-jennifer-lord), who started her independent position at LSTM as [Janet Hemingway Fellow](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/the-janet-hemingway-fellow-in-vector-biology-lecturer) in 2021. Together with Jenni and Ian, [Laura Brettell](https://lstm-microbial-genomics.github.io/MicGen-lab-website/members/laura-brettell.html) is currently investigating UK-based mosquito ISV diversity (_Aedes detritus_) as well as how to use ISVs to block arboviruses projects supported by internal funding for early-career researchers to move towards independence; Laura was awarded a Jean Clayton Fund in 2021 and a [Director's Catalyst Fund](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/director%E2%80%99s-catalyst-fund-0) in 2022.
