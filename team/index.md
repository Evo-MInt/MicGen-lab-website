# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Team

Our team spans a diverse range of research focusing around interactions between bacteria and their hosts as well as each other; and what evolutionary processes have led to this.
We use both computational and molecular biology methods; and span methods from mosquito microbiome transplantations to in-house sequencing and population genomics.
If you want to know a bit more about what each of us is doing, please take a look at our websites!

## Alumni

[Caitlin Duggan](https://research.lstmed.ac.uk/en/persons/caitlin-duggan-2) completed her MRes studies at LSTM co-supervised by [Tom Edwards](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-thomas-edwards), [Joe Lewis](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-joe-lewis) and myself, and continued as research associate for another year before embarking on her new PhD adventures at the University of Cardiff.

[Allan Zuza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Allan-Zuza) was based at [MLW](https://www.mlw.mw/) in Blantyre, Malawi, and has been part of the main _Klebsiella_ projects between [Nick Feasey](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/medicine/people/naf6/) and myself for several years; and completing his first first-author on [Typhi](https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/8-143). After successfully completing his masters studies, he has now moved as doctoral candidate to the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) to continue the work in the team of Nick Feasey on Klebsiella.

[Sarah Gallichan](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/sarah-gallichan) completed her PhD 12/2024 in Nick Feasey's team supervised by [Fabrice Graf]([https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-nicholas-feasey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabrice-graf-6a05b635/?originalSubdomain=uk)) co-supervised by myself, finishing some outstanding work on defining bacterial transmission events, with very important detailed methods development both on the [microbiology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39576089/) and the computational side (papers in prep). Sarah has now moved to St Andrews to continue working with [Nick Feasey](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/medicine/people/naf6/) who recently moved his team to Scotland, and we look forward to continue working with Sarah in a collaborative fashion.

[Aidan Foo]() successfully completed his PhD 12/2024 co-supervised by [Grant Hughes](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-grant-hughes) and myself, which resulted in two great publications, including a [tool to pull bacterial reads out of insect genome projects](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-131) and he led the analysis (and generated the wonderful figures!) for the [MOSAIC collection](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002897). Aidan has then moved into industry, we wish him best of luck in his future endeavours.

Nina is currently performing her PhD studies at LSHTM, good luck!

[Nicola Fletcher](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nicola-fletcher) Nikki worked with [Jennifer Lord](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-jennifer-lord), [Ian Patterson](https://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/biology/directory/ian-patterson/), [Tom Edwards](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-thomas-edwards) and myself on her MSc "Characterising the virome of UK mosquitoes" and completed successfully in 2021. We are very excited that Nikki will continue to work with us later this year on an MRC/DTP fellowship!

[Lucien Dobel-Ober](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lucien-dobel-ober) Lucien successfully completed his MSc project on "Identification of genomic traits of mosquito midgut associated symbionts" with us in 2021. Lucien will now continue on an MRC/DTP fellowship working with [Grant Hughes](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-grant-hughes) and [Philip McCall](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/Professor-philip-mccall), congratulations!

[Ralfh Pulmones](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ralfh-rolex-pulmones-169154151?trk=public_profile_browsemap) Ralfh successfully completed his MSc project on "Whole genome analysis of antibiotic resistance gene mobility in carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of GC2 _Acinetobacter baumannii_" with us in 2020; and successfully competed for an MRC/DTP PhD position where Ralfh worked with [Thomas Edwards](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-thomas-edwards) and myself on resistance mechanisms during the MRes rotations.
