# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Team

Our team spans a diverse range of research focusing around interactions between bacteria and their hosts as well as each other; and what evolutionary processes have led to this.
We use both computational and molecular biology methods; and span methods from mosquito microbiome transplantations to in-house sequencing and population genomics.
If you want to know a bit more about what each of us is doing, please take a look at our websites!
