I am interested in microbial ecology and evolution and insect-microbe interactions. During my PhD at the University of Salford and postdoc at Western Sydney University, I used a combination of field and laboratory studies along with bioinformatic analyses to investigate the ecology of viruses that infect insect pollinators, and to understand how viruses and other microbes affect pollinator health. Focus on mosquito-microbe interactions. 

I’m using laboratory studies and ‘omics techniques to understand what makes bacteria successful colonizers of the mosquito gut and how they interact with their host. I am also interested in insect-specific viruses and how these may affect mosquitoes.
