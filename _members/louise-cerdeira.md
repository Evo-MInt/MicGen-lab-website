Louise is part of Prof. Martin Donnelly's team, and has joined us this year to work on computational aspects of several projects. 

B.Sc. in Computer Science, M.Sc. in Genetics and Molecular Biology and PhD in Sciences at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2019 (with honours). More than ten years of experience in IT, Innovation, Research and Bioinformatic Strategic projects at private and public companies. Broad expertise in analyzing WGS data (genome, transcriptomic and metagenome) and comparative genomics techniques to investigate the diversity of pathogenic bacteria (ESKAPE) using the One Health approach. Have been working on developing tools to build a portable, low cost and sufficiently fast embedded system (GPU-based) to help reduce the data processing time, providing feasible and democratic sequencing analysis for LMIC. Co-developed the OneBR project and led the bioinformatics infrastructure and web architecture; also, coordinated and develop the TyphiNET web dashboard bioinformatics scientist in other medium and/or large research projects (Brazil, Australia, Africa, UK, USA, Argentina, Peru and Chile), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ministry of Health, CNPQ, FAPESP and Capes. Research fellow in the microbial genomics lab in the Infectious Disease department and Data Futures Institute at Monash University (2020). Currently, Post-Doctoral Research Associate at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine working on the GAARD project where she is a lead bioinformatician, use a combination of approaches, including computer-based searches of existing genome databases; large scale collections and resistance screening of malaria mosquitoes in both East and West Africa, and laboratory crossing experiments to identify rare, resistance-associated variants.
