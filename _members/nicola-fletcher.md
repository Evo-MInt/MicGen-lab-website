Sarah completed an undergraduate in Genetics at the University of Pretoria and went on to pursue a Master of Science in Medicine with a focus in Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. She is currently working on a PhD in Clinical Sciences at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine within the [Nicholas Feasey](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-nicholas-feasey) and Eva Heinz lab groups. Her research involves working towards understanding bias introduction in laboratory practice and how it affects the microbial systems to help inform better modelling of the data for insight into ESBL-producing _E. coli_ transmission.


Nikki has now started her PhD project focusing on UK mosquito viromes, which will be supervised by [Jenni Lord](https://www.vbdecologylab.com/), Laura Brettell and Eva Heinz.
