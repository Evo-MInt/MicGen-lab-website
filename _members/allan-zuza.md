Allan is based at [MLW](https://www.mlw.mw/) in Blantyre, Malawi, and has been part of the main _Klebsiella_ projects between [Nick Feasey](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-nicholas-feasey) and myself for the last two years. Allan has now embarked on an MSc online program looking further into our _Klebsiella_ data.
