Naomi is a Daphne Jackson Fellow jointly supervised by Martin Donnelly and Eva Heinz. 
Naomi's current research focuses on the cis-regulation of metabolic insecticide resistance related gene expression in Anopheles gambiae using:

1. Allelic imbalance of gene expression to identify cis-regulated genes.

2. Supervised machine learning to predict the cis-regulatory modules controlling gene expression.
