Naomi is a Dorothy Hodgkin Fellow after completing her Daphne-Jackson fellowship (jointly supervised by [Martin Donnelly](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-martin-james-donnelly) and Eva Heinz). 
Naomi's Daphne-Jackson fellowship focused on the cis-regulation of metabolic insecticide resistance related gene expression in Anopheles gambiae using:

1. Allelic imbalance of gene expression to identify cis-regulated genes.

2. Supervised machine learning to predict the cis-regulatory modules controlling gene expression.

She is now building her independent research at LSTM as a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellow on the career track (=tenure track) scheme, congratulations!!
