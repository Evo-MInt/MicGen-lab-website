Shannon is based in [Mark Taylor's](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-mark-taylor) and [Grant Hughes'](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-grant-hughes) labs working on collaborative projects on insect-specific and nematode viruses between all our teams.

Computational biologist and part-time dabbler in the lab and kitchen. 
Interests lie in genomic/transcriptomic sequence analysis of a variety of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and RNA viruses. 
Current projects include analysis of the Wolbachia endosymbiont within mosquitoes and parasitic filarial nematodes, the impact that this endosymbiont has on the host, as well as other members of the microbiome and/or their impact on viral infections.
